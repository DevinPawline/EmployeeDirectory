### Issues:
I was a little worried with this homework, as I struggled with the previous homework deploying using MongoAtlas and Heroku. However I found this assignment very helpful in feeling more comfortable with react. I was able to successfully deploy using github pages, though this took sometime to debug! I am very proud of the my employee directoy!
